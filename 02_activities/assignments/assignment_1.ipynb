    "Track the Presence of Numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using a set to track which numbers are present, we can use a boolean list or an array (or similar structure) to keep track of which numbers in the range [0, max_num] are present in the input list. We create a list of size max_num + 1 where each index represents a number. If that number is present in the input list, we mark its corresponding index as True; otherwise, we leave it as False.\n",

    "Identify Missing Numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the boolean list set up, we can iterate through it and check for any False values. Each index that holds a False corresponds to a number that is missing from the input list. We collect these indices as the missing numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle Special Cases:\n",
