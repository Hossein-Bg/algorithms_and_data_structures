    "\n",
    "Our goal is to identify which numbers from this range are missing.\n",

    "Key idea: We can use the values in the input list to mark the indices corresponding to the numbers that are present.\n",
    "Steps for the Alternative Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: We iterate through the list and for each number x in the list, try to place x in its correct position (i.e., at index x).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the number 3 is present, it should be placed at index 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a number is already at the correct position, we leave it there.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a number cannot be placed at its correct index (due to duplicates or out-of-range values), we ignore that number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: After reordering the list, the positions that still contain values other than the number that should be there are the missing numbers.\n",
